    "MPI is a **specification** for the developers and users of __message passing libraries__. By itself, it is **NOT a library** - but rather the specification of what such a library should be. It specifies the names, calling sequences, and results of subroutines to be called from Fortran programs and the functions to be called from C programs. The programs that users write in Fortran and C are compiled with ordinary compilers and linked with the MPI library.\n",

    "### Communicator\n",
    "Communicator objects connect groups of processes in the MPI session. Each communicator gives each contained process an independent identifier and arranges its contained processes in an ordered topology. MPI also has explicit groups, but these are mainly good for organizing and reorganizing groups of processes before another communicator is made. MPI understands single group intracommunicator operations, and bilateral intercommunicator communication. In MPI-1, single group operations are most prevalent. Bilateral operations mostly appear in MPI-2 where they include collective communication and dynamic in-process management.\n",

    "Communicators can be partitioned using several MPI commands. These commands include MPI_COMM_SPLIT, where each process joins one of several colored sub-communicators by declaring itself to have that color.\n",

    "# MPI Communication Methods \n",
    "## Point-to-Point Communication \n",
    "MPI Point-to_Point communication is the most used communication method in MPI. It involves the transfer of a message from one process to a particular process in the same communicator. MPI provides blocking (synchronous) and non-blocking (asynchronous) Point-to-Point communication. With blocking communication, an MPI process sends a message to another MPI process and waits until the receiving process completely and correctly receives the message before it continues its work. On the other hand, a sending process using non-blocking communication sends a message to another MPI process and continues its work without waiting to ensure that the message has been correctly received by the receiving process.\n",
    "\n",
    "MPI-1 specifies mechanisms for both blocking and non-blocking point-to-point communication mechanisms, as well as the so-called 'ready-send' mechanism whereby a send request can be made only when the matching receive request has already been made\n",

    "- Processes can be collected into groups.\n",
    "- Each message is sent in a context, and must be received in the same context.\n",
    "- A group and context together form a communicator.\n",
    "- A process is identified by its rank in the group associated with a communicator.\n",
    "- There is a default communicator whose group contains all initial processes, called **MPI_COMM_WORLD**.\n",

    "## MPI Datatypes\n",
    "\n",
    "The data in a message to sent or received is described by a triple (address, count, datatype), where\n",
    "- An MPI datatype is recursively defined as:\n",
    "    - predefined, corresponding to a data type from the language (e.g., **MPI_INT, MPI_DOUBLE_PRECISION**)\n",

    "    - a strided block of datatypes\n",
    "    - an indexed array of blocks of datatypes\n",
    "    - an arbitrary structure of datatypes\n",
    "There are MPI functions to construct custom datatypes, such an array of (int, float) pairs, or a row of a matrix stored columnwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## MPI Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "- Messages are sent with an accompanying user-defined integer tag, to assist the receiving process in identifying the message.\n",
    "- Messages can be screened at the receiving end by specifying a specific tag, or not screened by specifying **MPI_ANY_TAG** as the tag in a receive.\n",
    "- Some non-MPI message-passing systems have called tags “message types”. **MPI calls them tags to avoid confusion with datatypes**\n",

In this lesson, I will discuss how to use MPI's blocking sending and receiving functions, and I will also overview other basic concepts associated with transmitting data using MPI.\r\n",
    ".\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Overview of sending and receiving with MPI\r\n",
    "MPI's send and receive calls operate in the following manner. First, process *A* decides a message needs to be sent to process *B*. Process A then packs up all of its necessary data into a buffer for process B. These buffers are often referred to as *envelopes* since the data is being packed into a single message before transmission (similar to how letters are packed into envelopes before transmission to the post office). After the data is packed into a buffer, the communication device (which is often a network) is responsible for routing the message to the proper location. The location of the message is defined by the process's rank.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Even though the message is routed to B, process B still has to acknowledge that it wants to receive A's data. Once it does this, the data has been transmitted. Process A is acknowledged that the data has been transmitted and may go back to work.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Sometimes there are cases when A might have to send many different types of messages to B. Instead of B having to go through extra measures to differentiate all these messages, MPI allows senders and receivers to also specify message IDs with the message (known as *tags*). When process B only requests a message with a certain tag number, messages with different tags will be buffered by the network until B is ready for them.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "With these concepts in mind, let's look at the prototypes for the MPI sending and receiving functions.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "```cpp\r\n",
    "MPI_Send(\r\n",
    "    void* data,\r\n",
    "    int count,\r\n",
    "    MPI_Datatype datatype,\r\n",
    "    int destination,\r\n",

    "    MPI_Comm communicator,\r\n",
    "    MPI_Status* status)\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Although this might seem like a mouthful when reading all of the arguments, they become easier to remember since almost every MPI call uses similar syntax. The first argument is the data buffer. The second and third arguments describe the count and type of elements that reside in the buffer. `MPI_Send` sends the exact count of elements, and `MPI_Recv` will receive **at most** the count of elements (more on this in the next lesson). The fourth and fifth arguments specify the rank of the sending/receiving process and the tag of the message. The sixth argument specifies the communicator and the last argument (for `MPI_Recv` only) provides information about the received message.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Elementary MPI datatypes\r\n",
    "The `MPI_Send` and `MPI_Recv` functions utilize MPI Datatypes as a means to specify the structure of a message at a higher level. For example, if the process wishes to send one integer to another, it would use a count of one and a datatype of `MPI_INT`. The other elementary MPI datatypes are listed below with their equivalent C datatypes.\r\n",
